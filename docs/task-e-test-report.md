# Task E Test Report

Date: 2026-04-14

## Scope

Task E assembles Task D segment-level synthesis outputs back onto the original
background timeline and exports:

- `dub_voice.<target_tag>.wav`
- `preview_mix.<target_tag>.wav`
- `timeline.<target_tag>.json`
- `mix_report.<target_tag>.json`
- `task-e-manifest.json`

This validation round is based on the new `Qwen3-TTS` Task D pipeline and the
updated stage-isolated A→E demo script.

## Automated Tests

Command:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

Result:

- `35 passed`

Task E related coverage includes:

- CLI parsing for `render-dub`
- failed Task D segment passthrough behavior when audio exists
- overlap resolution
- fit strategies: `direct`, `compress`, `pad`
- preview mix export

## Real Render Validation

```bash

### Final Artifacts

- [dub_voice.en.wav](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/task-e-noskip/voice/dub_voice.en.wav)
- [preview_mix.en.wav](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/task-e-noskip/voice/preview_mix.en.wav)
- [timeline.en.json](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/task-e-noskip/voice/timeline.en.json)
- [mix_report.en.json](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/task-e-noskip/voice/mix_report.en.json)
- [task-e-manifest.json](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/task-e-noskip/voice/task-e-manifest.json)

### Observed Result

Task E completed successfully.

- `placed_count = 90`
- `skipped_count = 78`
- fit strategies:
  - `direct = 17`
  - `compress = 32`
  - `pad = 7`
  - `overflow_unfitted = 27`
  - `underflow_unfitted = 7`
- skipped reasons:
  - `skipped_overlap = 78`
- total timeline duration:
  - `534.593s`

Task E consumed Task D reports from 6 speakers:

- [spk_0000](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/e2e-task-a-to-e-qwen-full/task-d/voice/spk_0000/speaker_segments.en.json)
- [spk_0001](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/e2e-task-a-to-e-qwen-full/task-d/voice/spk_0001/speaker_segments.en.json)
- [spk_0002](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/e2e-task-a-to-e-qwen-full/task-d/voice/spk_0002/speaker_segments.en.json)
- [spk_0003](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/e2e-task-a-to-e-qwen-full/task-d/voice/spk_0003/speaker_segments.en.json)
- [spk_0004](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/e2e-task-a-to-e-qwen-full/task-d/voice/spk_0004/speaker_segments.en.json)
- [spk_0007](/Users/masamiyui/OpenSoureProjects/Forks/translip/tmp/e2e-task-a-to-e-qwen-full/task-d/voice/spk_0007/speaker_segments.en.json)

Representative placed segments in the final timeline include:

- `seg-0004` from `spk_0000`
- `seg-0007` and `seg-0009` from `spk_0001`
- `seg-0012`, `seg-0013`, `seg-0018` from `spk_0003`

## What Changed In This Round

Compared with the previous development-only Task E run:

- the upstream Task D backend is now `Qwen3-TTS`
- the failed Task D segments are no longer filtered out before fit and overlap handling
- overlong and undersized segments are also kept instead of being dropped at fit time
- the placed segment count improved from `38` to `90`
- the remaining skips are now entirely overlap-driven in this validation run

## Remaining Limits

- Task E now places many more segments, but that also increases overlap pressure
- current overlap resolution will still drop later conflicting segments when a
  stronger candidate already occupies the same time window
- the biggest upstream bottleneck remains duration mismatch on short lines
- current mix is still a preview mix, not final-grade mastering
- because Task D is local and conservative, some English lines still sound longer than the source timing window allows

## Conclusion

Task E is now validated on a full real-video run with the migrated
`Qwen3-TTS` Task D pipeline. The end-to-end local workflow from stage 1 through
Task E completes successfully on `MacBook M4 16GB`, and the current remaining
gap is quality/yield optimization rather than pipeline breakage.

## 2026-04-15 Follow-up: `哪吒预告片.mp4`

An additional real-world validation was recorded on:

- source video: `/Users/masamiyui/Downloads/哪吒预告片.mp4`
- pipeline root: `/Users/masamiyui/.cache/translip/output-pipeline/task-20260415-093104`

This follow-up is important because it exposed a failure mode that is different
from a hard pipeline crash.

### Initial observed symptom

The first exported dub video for this task did not lose total runtime, but it
subjectively "missed many voiced lines".

Observed state before the fix:

- `Task E placed_count = 14`
- `Task E skipped_count = 15`
- total timeline duration still matched the source video duration

This means the issue was not "Task G exported a truncated video". The issue was
that many segment audios were already being dropped before final muxing.

### Root cause recorded from this run

Two causes stacked together:

1. `Task D` over-generated many short lines
   - `Qwen3-TTS` token budgeting was too loose for the model's `12Hz` audio
     token rate
   - several short lines became much longer than their source timing windows

2. `Task E` conservative fitting still allowed some short overruns to stay as
   passthrough segments
   - those segments then occupied the next line's window
   - overlap resolution skipped the weaker neighbor instead of fitting both

### State after the fix

After the Task D token-budget fix and the Task E fit-policy refinement, the
same real task was re-rendered again.

Observed state after the fix:

- `Task E placed_count = 29`
- `Task E skipped_count = 0`
- fit strategies:
  - `compress = 24`
  - `pad = 5`

The recorded takeaway is:

- when final audio "sounds incomplete", first inspect `Task E mix_report`
- if `placed_count` is low, treat it as a timeline-yield problem, not a video
  export problem
- once `placed_count` returns to full coverage, remaining work moves to `Task D`
  segment-quality cleanup instead of Task E timeline recovery
